# movie-watchlist-react 

One of the solo projects that was part of the Scrimba's FDCP (Module 9: Working with APIs). 

However I decided to refactor and use React instead of vanilla JS.
I used OMDb API (https://www.omdbapi.com/) here to fetch the movie data.

You can see this project live here at: https://moviewatchlistgc.netlify.app/mywatchlist
